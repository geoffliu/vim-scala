This is a fork of derekwyatt/vim-scala. It gets rid of a few settings that's been bugging me, but I couldn't push them upstream to Derek. Hence this fork.

If you have Vundle installed, simply add the following to your .vimrc:
  Bundle 'geoffliu/vim-scala'
and then run
  :BundleInstall
to install it.
